# All Cheats

* `shift+>`|`==`  - indent
* `=`             - indent in visual
* `shift+<`       - outdent 
* `tabe`          - open a file in a new tab
* `ctrl+l`        - cancel contents of search
* `<Leader>reg`   - to see all registers (registers all start with `"` )
* `U`             - return line to original state
* `ctrl+r "`      - paste while in insert mode 
* `ctrl+n`        - try to autocomplete from match in file
* `%`             - jump to matching bracket
* `I`             - go to beginning of the line in append mode
* `''`            - go back to where cursor was last
* `C`             - change to the end of the line
* `D`             - delete to the end of the line
* `ctrl+v`        - visual block mode (use hjkl to select)
* `}` and `{`     - backwards/fowards by paragraphs (hops whitespaces)
* `)` and `(`     - backwards/fowards by sentances (hops whitespaces)
* `gv`            - reselect last selection
* `<L><L>w`       - open easymotion
* `ci"`           - replace inside `"` (this can also be `{/}/[/]` etc)
* `*`, `cw`, `n`, `.` put word under cursor in register, change it, use `n` to jump to next instance and `.` if you want to repeat the change
* `ctrl-r`,`0`    - paste in "insert" mode (from register 0)
* `gt`            - to switch between tabs
* `ctrl+o`        - to jump to previous location
* `:set ft=x`     - set file type
* `f`|`F`         - search forwards/search backwards
* `cgn`           - use `/search` to find something, then `cgn` to replace... then `.` to apply elsewhere (cool part is that it changes substrings) `gn` is a motion meaning "select the next search match" - so cgn is replace the next search match
* `q:`            - cmdwin mode - can see all previous commands and use normal/insert mode. When ready to execute, `ctrl-c` on the line you want to execute (normal behavior is `<cr>` but I have that mapped to insert new line)
