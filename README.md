# vimrc

## To do by hand
Everything need to get vim going is embedded in vimrc. Open a document with vim and it will install vim-plug automatically

1. `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JaredVogt/vimrc/master/.vimrc`
2. run vim
3. `:PlugInstall` to load all plugins

## OSX
To get the latest version of vim - grab brew
* `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
* `brew install vim` - installs vim to `/usr/local/bin/vim`
* `brew install macvim` - installs macvim to `/usr/local/bin/mvim` - create alias to use

### Random additional setup things

* to get lastest bash, `brew install bash`
* need node, coffee, nvm, npm, etc
* .bash_profile and aliases
* on ubuntu, have to make sure that vim is set to use python - `sudo apt install vim-nox` and voila, it just works.
