# Things learned

There are 5 modes in vim that one uses all the time

* normal - `esc` (and what ever esc has been mapped to - jj/numluck/etc)
* insert - `i` and a whole host of other things
* visual - `v`
* search - `/`
* command - `:`


### Search
* vim-sensible sets up `<C-L>` to clear the highlighting
* `:set paste` to paste in without autoindent, `:set nopaste` to turn it off
